      <h2 class="page-header">Complete Designer Kitchen Remodelers in Las Vegas</h2>
      <p class="lead">Las Vegas' Team Tile and Stone, LLC. can design, create, craft and install the kitchen of your dreams (well, at least the dreamiest kitchen for the space you have). With all the steps involved, including codes, permits and liscening, where working with one contractor can save you many a migrane and money as well. Your newly remodeled kitchen will provide you with relief from the frustration of having inefficiencient layouts and preparation areas and a lifetime of pleasure, relaxation, openess &amp; enjoyment. So while you benefit from the beauty, you can also relish in the comfort of knowing that you've increased the resale value of your home. <i><strong>PROVEN FACT:</strong> Homes with upgraded kichens, bathrooms (esp master bath) and/or premium flooring are the most sought after properties and, therefore, always will bring in higher bids from homebuyers.</i></p>
      <p class="lead">With all we have learned in our 35 years of tile and stone remodeling, we know how to turn you concept into a magnificent realty for your pleasure, always keeping in mind quality, longevity, and stunning appearance.</p>
      <p class="lead">Our primary goal is your satisfaction throughout the timeline of any project, large or small. From designing custom backsplashes to complete kitchen renovation rehauls, our principle focus remains the dedication towards a finished job that matches (or exceeds) both parties expectations. Combined with our many decades of experience and our "realistic approach" to maintaining options that are strictly within the realm of availability and efficiency, we envision a clearer picture of what is to come. More simply, we're not promising anything we can not deliver. That is not to say that there are projects that we are unable to accomplish, but merely stating that our foundation is created with honesty, integrity and direct, level-minded communication.</p>
      <p class="lead">There seems to be an overwhelming number of contractors or businesses in our industry sadly adhereing to this 'we can do anything for any price' activity. Sadly, it's rampant throughout the field, some are guilty a lot more than others who will hide costs in cheaper 'behind-the-scenes' items. False guarantees and budget-only marketing only leads to poorer, less compitent craftsmanship. Witnessing the slow degredation years later, or, in some cases, being called upon weeks after the work has been completed, is terribly disheartening. Replacing materials such as marble/granite countertops, stone veneers and others that should have lasted a lifetime (or at least as long as the house stands) because of someone else's shotty work is never quite as thrilling for us or for the customer, who now needs to add more into a project that should have been completed already.
      <p> aftermaths so many of these transactions can be discouraging for the population, but also to us! Why take this different stance? It certainly doesn't help our popularity within the field. It may even be hindering our progress to land large numbers of jobs. We certainly make it more difficult without our name on vehicles and work vans spread around Las Vegas, all with a confidently and nearly capable "saleman", practicing his/her pitch and heading to a neighborhood near you.

      <p class="lead">Beauty and elegance, combined with functionality is what we aim to achieve. Stone, glass, mosaics, tile, slabs, or other materials are all possible for the completion of your ultimate kitchen. </p>
