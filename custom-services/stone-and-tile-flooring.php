      <h2 class="page-header">Expert Tile &amp; Stone Floor Installations</h2>
      <p class="lead">Team Tile and Stone, LLC. is a Las Vegas contractor specializing in installations of quality tiled floors, natural stone, marble and ceramic tile flooring. Team Tile &amp; Stone are seasoned professionals ensuring each job gets done correctly, the first time. Because every project is different, hiring the right contractor is essential, especially for long-term durability and hidden complications. When stone and tile flooring installations are combined with an elegant touch, the stunning appearance of the finished product can last a lifetime(s). Removing ever larger and old(er) areas for renovation, increases the possibilities of uncovering patchwork, uneven joints, mystery adhesives and damage that was hidden from view. Any of these minor &lsquo;discoveries&rsquo; could lead to major issues during the installation or even cause a delay beginning a job.
      <p>
      <p class="lead">The best flooring installers are those that have the experience dealing with these issues. Any expert in any field will tell you that there is no substitution for hands-on experience. It's great to keep learning and continue ongoing training (which we do as well), but by actually gutting old floorboards and installing many types of stone floors in many more homes and entryways, we are always one, two, three or more steps (pun intended!) ahead of resolving possible issues BEFORE they arise. This is precisely the reason to hire a contractor who has seen it all, done it all and has the passion to continue educating themselves with specialty tiles, edging, grout, adhesives and backer boards. These are best sorted out by experts who know what they're doing. <i><strong>PROVEN FACT:</strong> Homes with upgraded kitchens, bathrooms (esp master bath) and/or premium flooring are the most sought after properties and, therefore, always will bring in higher bids from home buyers.</i></p>
      <p class="lead">With all we have learned in our 35 years of tile and stone remodeling, we know how to turn you concept into a magnificent realty for your pleasure, always keeping in mind quality, longevity, and stunning appearance. Even a small error in floor, wall, or bath tile can be an eyesore. One minutely mispositioned tile, for example, can throw off the pattern and grout line, making the goof glaring. Worse, fixing a botched tiling job is expensive, disruptive and messy, especially if water has seeped through the grout and ruined framing, ceilings and finished walls. </p>
      <p class="lead">Our primary goal is your satisfaction throughout the timeline of any project, large or small. From designing custom backsplashes to complete kitchen renovation rebuild, our principle focus remains the dedication towards a finished job that matches (or exceeds) both parties expectations. Combined with our many decades of experience and our "realistic approach" to maintaining options that are strictly within the realm of availability and efficiency, we envision a clearer picture of what is to come. More simply, we're not promising anything we can not deliver. That is not to say that there are projects that we are unable to accomplish, but merely stating that our foundation is created with honesty, integrity and direct, level-minded communication.</p>
      <p class="lead">Tile and  stone flooring is beautiful and durable and it should be itâ€™s been thousands of years in the making. There are several types of tile and stone flooring granite, slate, rectified porcelain tile, and marble. Replacing carpet, laminate, or hardwood with a natural stone will always increase the resale value of your home. Tile and stone is a prime choice for luxury homes, and is almost always a sign of the wealthy and elite.
        Stone flooring comes from natural solid rock. This natural rock is cut and then re-cut to the desired shape and then polished. It is also the only flooring that improves with age.</p>
      <p class="lead"><strong>Granite flooring</strong> is the most durable. It is very stain resistant. Not only can it be used for floors, but it can also be used for counter-tops and backslashes. <strong>Marble</strong> is less expensive than granite and is ideal for bathroom vanities, backslashes and other areas with moisture. <strong>Limestone flooring</strong> is formed primarily of organic materials. It often complements an older style interior. Limestone is also the softest of the natural stones. Because of this, it is not suited for high traffic areas.</p>
      <p class="lead"><strong>Slate flooring</strong> is a fantastic choice as a compliment to another type of stone or material. It is not as shiny as marble and granite? It is a modern or rustic style in appearance ?? steve needs to confirm. <strong>Ceramic tile</strong> is a pressed clay with a glazed top. This type of flooring has been around since ancient times. It is an extremely popular flooring choice because of its durability and general ease of maintenance. It comes in a wide variety of different colors, styles and sizes. Ceramic tiling can be used on walls, floors, as backsplashes and as a decorative wall covering. It is a great choice for kitchens, bathrooms, laundry rooms and generally any area that tends to receive excessive moisture. <strong>Rectified porcelain tile</strong> is a highly compressed porcelain that is baked at an unbelievably high temperature and is the most durable. It is actually almost unbreakable! Great for floors, walls, bathrooms, showers and, really, for any area. Another very popular choice right now.</p>
